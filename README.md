# Machine Learning by Stanford

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the "Machine Learning" course by Stanford University! This repository contains my solutions to programming assignments, notes, and additional resources related to the course.

## Course Description

The "Machine Learning" course, taught by Andrew Ng, is a foundational course in the field. It covers essential machine learning concepts and techniques, including:

- Linear Regression and Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
- Recommender Systems

## Structure

The repository is organized by weeks, with each week's materials and programming assignments stored in their respective directories (`Week1`, `Week2`, etc.). The assignments include both coding exercises and theoretical questions to reinforce your understanding.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and materials, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Machine-Learning-by-Stanford.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired week's directory:

   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-by-Stanford/WeekX
   ```

3. Open and explore the assignment files using your preferred code editor.

## Requirements

- Octave/MATLAB: The programming assignments are primarily done using Octave or MATLAB. Make sure to have one of them installed on your machine.
- Other dependencies as specified in the course instructions.

Ensure that you have the necessary software installed before running the code.

## Contribution

Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome! If you find any issues or have improvements to suggest, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my appreciation to Andrew Ng and the Stanford University team for offering this invaluable course. The knowledge gained here is fundamental to understanding and applying machine learning concepts.

Happy coding!
